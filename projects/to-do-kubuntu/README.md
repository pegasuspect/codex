# To-Do Kubuntu

A Kubuntu-native task program explored through ten deliberately different
iterations before implementation.

## Iteration 1 - Plasma Pinboard

Tasks are not rows. They are small "plasmoids" grouped by the KDE surface they
belong to: panel, launcher, desktop, terminal, browser, and files.

### Pseudocode

```text
read tasks
detect current KDE surface
group tasks by surface
show the current surface first
when user completes a task:
  mark done
  log the surface that helped finish it
```

### Summary

This starts from Kubuntu's workspace metaphor instead of a generic inbox.

### Why It Is Unique

The task list behaves like a memory of the Plasma desktop, not a calendar,
Kanban board, or plain checklist.
